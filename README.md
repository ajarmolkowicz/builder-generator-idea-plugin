# Builder Generator Idea plugin ![build](https://github.com/mjedynak/builder-generator-idea-plugin/actions/workflows/build-gradle-project.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that adds ability to generate builder for a class and switch between them.

Switching between builder and source class is similar to 'Go To Test' action.

Generated builder class does not use reflection, only setter methods or constructor.
